- Promise-Based: Axios uses promises, making it easy to handle asynchronous requests.
- Error Handling: Provides built-in error handling for more robust API calls.
- Automatic JSON Parsing: Axios automatically parses JSON responses, making it easier to work with the data.

## Additional Functionalities

- Data Parsing: The app extracts key weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and condition descriptions from the JSON response.
